# Working with Expectation–Maximization

## Background
Unlike the traditional backprop training regimens used for training feedforward neural networks, predictive coding networks are trained using expectation–maximization (EM) based procedures (given under various names, such as *inference learning* or *prospective configuration*).

EM breaks the task
