### [Classifying MNIST with a Hierarchical PCN](<tutorials/mnist-classifier-pcn:Classifying MNIST with a Hierarchical PCN>)

This example goes over building a discriminative hierarchical predictive coding network (PCN), and training it to classify the MNIST dataset. It covers the basic concepts of PCNs and how training them differs from training a feedforward neural network (FNN) using backpropagation.
